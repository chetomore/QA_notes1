#BIOS

Basic Input/Output System
It's a small program stored on the chip of your cmptr mthrbrd
It's job is to start your PC and load the OS

What Does BIOS Do?
Here‚Äôs what happens when you press the power button:

Power On: You press the button.
BIOS Starts: The BIOS chip wakes up and runs its code.
POST (Power-On Self Test): BIOS checks if your hardware (RAM, CPU, keyboard, etc.) is working.
Boot Loader: BIOS finds the storage device (like SSD/HDD) and loads the OS from it.
OS Takes Over: Once the OS starts, BIOS steps back.


BIOS starts first when you power on the computer.
It performs a hardware check (POST).
Then it finds the boot device (like SSD/HDD).
Loads the bootloader (e.g., GRUB).
Finally, the Operating System start

UEFI?
UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.


Security Features in UEFI
Secure Boot: Prevents unauthorized OS or malware from loading.
TPM Integration: Works with encryption tools like BitLocker.
Password Protection: Can lock firmware settings.

BIOS/UEFI can configure system bus and clock speed, but with limitations and safety checks. Here's how it works:

üß† What Are System Bus and Clock Speed?
System Bus: Transfers data between CPU, RAM, and other components.
Clock Speed: Determines how fast the CPU and other components operate (measured in MHz or GHz).
‚öôÔ∏è BIOS/UEFI Configuration Options
In many systems, especially desktops and gaming laptops, BIOS/UEFI allows you to:

‚úÖ Configure:
CPU multiplier (affects clock speed)
Base clock (BCLK) frequency
RAM frequency and timings
Voltage settings for CPU and RAM
‚ùå Cannot Configure:
Physical bus architecture (e.g., PCIe lanes)
Deep chipset-level timings (unless unlocked)

Let‚Äôs say your CPU runs at:

Base Clock = 100 MHz
Multiplier = 36
So, CPU Speed = 100 √ó 36 = 3.6 GHz

In BIOS, you can:

Increase multiplier to 40 ‚Üí 4.0 GHz
Adjust RAM speed from 2400 MHz to 3200 MHz
This is called overclocking, and it‚Äôs often used to boost performance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks of Changing These Settings
Overheating
System instability
Warranty void
Data loss if unstable
Modern BIOS/UEFI often includes safe limits, auto-recovery, and thermal protection.

Why TPM Is Important
TPM helps your system:

Boot securely (with Secure Boot)
Encrypt your disk (with BitLocker or LUKS)
Prevent unauthorized access
Detect tampering or malware before the OS loads

Here‚Äôs a simplified flow:

Power On ‚Üí BIOS/UEFI starts
TPM checks system integrity (bootloader, OS files)
If everything is clean:
TPM releases the encryption key
OS boots normally
If something is tampered:
TPM locks the key
OS won‚Äôt boot or asks for recovery


SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over an unsecured network. It encrypts the session to protect data and credentials.

Common SSH Use Cases:
Remote login to servers: ssh user@hostname
Secure file transfer: scp or rsync over SSH
Tunneling and port forwarding
Git operations over SSH

üîë How They Work Together in SSH
RSA is used during the initial handshake:

The client uses the server‚Äôs public RSA key to encrypt a random session key.
Only the server can decrypt it using its private RSA key.
Once the session key is securely shared, AES takes over:

All further communication is encrypted using AES with that session key.

This ensures fast and secure data transfer.
